# Yard_Management_Solution
A predictive yard optimisation model that consider dwell time uncertainty as well as re-allocation of blocking containers

My algorithm considers the yard optimisation problem as a two-part problem:
1. Predicting the dwell time of incoming containers accurately
2. Matching empty slots with incoming containers to minimize the number of moves per container
